#'
#' @description Parse a string of phase I dose-finding outcomes to a binary
#' vector notation necessary for model invocation.
#'
#' The outcome string describes the doses given, outcomes observed and groups
#' patients into cohorts. The format of the string is described in Brock (2019),
#' and that itself is the phase I analogue of the similar idea described in
#' Brock et al. (2017). See Examples.
#'
#' The letters T and N are used to represents patients that experienced
#' (T)oxicity and (N)o toxicity. These letters are concatenated after numerical
#' dose-levels to convey the outcomes of cohorts of patients.
#' For instance, \code{2NNT} represents a cohort of three patients that were
#' treated at dose-level 2, one of whom experienced toxicity, and two that did
#' not. The results of cohorts are separated by spaces. Thus, \code{2NNT 1NN}
#' extends our previous example, where the next cohort of two were treated at
#' dose-level 1 and neither experienced toxicity. See examples.
#'
#' @param outcomes character string, conveying doses given and outcomes
#' observed.
#' @param as_list TRUE (the default) to return a \code{list};
#' FALSE to return a \code{data.frame}
#'
#' @return If \code{as_list == TRUE}, a list with elements \code{tox},
#' \code{doses} and \code{num_patients}. These elements are congruent with those
#' of the same name in \code{crm_params}, for example.
#' If \code{as_list == FALSE}, a data.frame with columns \code{tox} and
#' \code{doses}.

#' # Three cohorts of three patients. The first cohort was treated at dose 1 and
#' # non had toxicity. The seond cohort was treated at dose 2 and one of the
#' # three had toxicity. Finally, cohort three was treated at dose 3 and all
#' # patients had toxicity. See:
#' x$num_patients  # 9
#' x$doses         # c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)
#' x$tox           # c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1)
#' sum(x$tox)      # 4
#'
#' # The same information can be parsed to a data-frame:
#' y = parse_phase1_outcomes('1NNN 2NTN 3TTT', as_list = FALSE)
#' y
